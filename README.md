# Bioinformatics 
Bioinformatics is the computer-aided study of biological data. In general, bioinformatics focuses on extracting new information from massive quantities of biological data and requires that scientists know the tools and methods for capturing, processing and analyzing large data sets. Learning how to design experiments and perform advanced statistical analysis is essential for anyone interested in this field.<br>Bioinformatics includes Three major parts: Sequence Analysis, Structural Bioinformatics, and Systems Biology. Each part deals with different biological issues which needs various skills and abilities to be expert at. For example, bioinformatics scientists are tasked with performing high-throughput, next-generation sequencing in Sequence Analysis part. They analyze DNA sequence alignment to find mutations and anomalies and understand the impact on cellular processes. For Structural Bioinformatics, a bioinformatician uses different approaches to analyze protein structure and its impact on cell function. For Systems Biology part, a bioinformatician deals with genes, proteins, and other biological molecules considering their interactions as well.<br> In this course, we try to deal with some primary bioinformatics analysis methods used for study of biological data (mostly in Sequence Analysis part).<br>We also recommend interested students to participate in Computational and Systems Biology course (for Systems Biology part) and Protein Engineering course (for Structural Bioinformatics part).
